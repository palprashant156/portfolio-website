This functionality helps users to stay informed about the performance of their holdings, enabling them to make data-driven investment decisions.
        
    </br> Real-Time Bitcoin Price Graph
        A standout feature of the platform is the real-time graph that tracks Bitcoin price fluctuations over various time periods, including 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month. This graph provides users with valuable insights into market trends and helps them to better understand price movements and market dynamics.
        
    </br>Transaction History
        To enhance transparency and usability, the platform allows users to view recent transactions, including deposits and sales. Detailed information such as date, time, and amount for each transaction is provided, ensuring users have a clear record of their financial activities.
        
    </br>Fund Management
        The platform facilitates efficient fund management by providing options for users to deposit and withdraw funds directly from the dashboard. This seamless integration simplifies financial operations and improves user convenience.
